# functions
# Pass by object referenc
# Notes:
# ------
# 1. In Python, the values are sent to functions by means of object references.
#    We know everything is considered as an object in Python.
#    All numbers are objects, strings are objects, and the datatypes like tuples, lists,
#    and dictionaries are also objects.
#
# 2. When we pass values like numbers, strings, tuples or lists to a function,
#    the references of these objects are passed to the function.
#
# 3. How objects are stored and tagged
